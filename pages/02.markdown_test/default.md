# Markdown Test

``` python
import pandas as pd
pd.to_datetime('June 6 2017 5pm')
```

I suppose I understand the hesitation to integrate.[^1]


[^1]: I wrote a `numba.jit` vectorized addition routine that ran 3 times faster than `numpy`, and I'm not a bare-metal engineer. But it would be harder to deal with, as I found out. I got farther into a different project, thinking that I could do the same thing there. _Au contraire._ I was using the `collections.deque`, which is not implemented. As the 'Homeland Generation' says, "**RIP me.**" No joy there.
