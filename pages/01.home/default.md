# Welcome
My name is Alex. I help people. I am a medical student at Midwestern University, Glendale.


## FAQ
- Why is the website's name [dralexcrist.com](dralexcrist.com) if you're not done with school?
	- I'm glad you asked. I had some trepidation about that myself. It's presumptuous, right? I have a three-part answer:
		- Being a doctor isn't about being recognized as an MD or DO. I think it's evident in something I've observed in every medical practice I've ever visited. Ask any doctor if his or her coworkers are APRNs, DNPs, PAs, MDs, or DOs. About 80% of the time, they *don't know*. It's about a dedication to medicine. When others sense that, the particulars drop away. Did you know that "doctor" means teacher? It has no specific medical denotation.
		- My parents maintained a blog called [alexcrist.com](alexcrist.com)[^1] during my time serving as a missionary in Chile. They'd post my exploits on a very 1990s-looking Blogspot site. I think it even had ads. My dad had the idea to grab the [alexcrist.com](alexcrist.com) domain, and just forward it on. They spread it around a bunch and before long, there was a decent-sized readership on the thing. (My parents were the marketers there; I'm a pretty bland writer.) When it expired, the domain registrars decided to ask $710 to renew. I didn't really know about that sort of thing in 2010, so I've decided to walk away from that name.
		- While[^i] I would have chosen medicine without any titles, it's cool that there are titles involved. They're pretty bad-A, as it were.
