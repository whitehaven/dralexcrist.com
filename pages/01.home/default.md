# Welcome
My name is Alex. I help people. I am a medical student at Midwestern University, Glendale. I am also a health systems researcher. I care a lot about trying to get others to adopt empiricism and automation when such things are warranted. ([And they are quite often.][Beh Econ])


## FAQ
- Why is the website's name [dralexcrist.com](dralexcrist.com) and not alexcrist.com[^1] if you're not done with school?
	- I'm glad you asked. I had some trepidation about that myself. It's presumptuous, right? I have a two-part answer:
		- Being a doctor isn't about being recognized as an MD or DO.
    - My parents maintained a blog called alexcrist.com[^1] during my time serving as a missionary in Chile. They'd post my exploits on a very 1990s-looking Blogspot site. I think it even had ads. My dad had the idea to grab the alexcrist.com[^1] domain, and just forward it on. They spread it around a bunch and before long, there was a decent-sized readership on the thing. When it expired, the domain registrars asked 710 smacks to renew. Needless to say, I'd prefer to just give my money directly to a raccoon and eliminate the middle man.


[^1]: I'm *not* recommending that you look at alexcrist.com. It probably has a fun phishing scam on it now.
